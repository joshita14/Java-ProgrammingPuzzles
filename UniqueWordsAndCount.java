	 * A train is one mile long. It travels at the rate of one mile a minute through a tunnel which is also one mile long. 
	 * Can you say how long it will take for the train to pass completely through the tunnel? 
	 * 
	 * it will take two minutes if you count the time for it to completely pass through the tunnel. One minute to pass through the tunnel and another 
	 * one minute to drag itself out of the tunnel completely so two minutes nice question though well logical.
